# Simulation model

used for simulation-based forecasting and system emulation

## Emulation

- emulates real system to test the overall setup
- runs in real-time mode
- publishes events of system state-changes

## Simulation

- is run to evaluate the current system state and create forecasts
- runs in virtual time mode (as fast as possible)
- is initialized based on the WIP
